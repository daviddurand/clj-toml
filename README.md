# clj-toml

clj-toml is [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml) for Clojure. TOML is Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language. 

> TOML is like INI, only better (Tom Preston-Werner)

clj-toml uses [Kern](https://github.com/blancas/kern) for parsing. Kern does all the heavy lifting, we're just sitting pretty.

clj-toml comes with a decent [collection of tests](https://github.com/lantiga/clj-toml/blob/master/test/clj_toml/core_test.clj). It successfully parses the TOML [hard example](https://github.com/mojombo/toml/blob/master/tests/hard_example.toml). Easy peasy.

Supported TOML version: [b098bd2b06920b69102bd4929cc5d7784893a123](https://github.com/mojombo/toml/tree/b098bd2b06920b69102bd4929cc5d7784893a123).

## Usage

Leiningen:

```clojure
[clj-toml "0.3.0"]
```

Test:

```clojure
lein test
```

Use:

```clojure
(use 'clj-toml.core)

(parse-string "
title = \"TOML\"
[Foo]
bar=[1,2,3]")
;; {"title" "TOML" "foo" {"bar" [1 2 3]}}
```

## TODO

The parser is pretty solid (thanks to Kern) and complete. 

In a way it implements a superset of TOML, since it successfully parses

* non-homogeneous arrays
* TOML with duplicate keys
* multiline strings

As the TOML specification stabilizes, we'll raise errors according to specification.
